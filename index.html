    <h2 id='about'>About Me</h2>
    <p>I graduated from Virginia Tech with a BA in Applied Communications and Marketing. For the past eight years, I've worked in digital communications and marketing within the nonprofit sector and sports industry, gaining experience in social media, email marketing, and web design.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding as a Thinkful student, I am a professional NBA dancer as well as an operations associate for a luxury sports club. Through my dance and fitness passions, I've learned what it takes to be a team player, problem-solver, and performer which can all translate directly to the software engineering space.</p>

    <p>Aside from dancing and strength training, other hobbies I enjoy include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Organizing</li>
      <li>Crafting</li>
      <li>Cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am excited to learn and improve my skills on this new journey!</p>
